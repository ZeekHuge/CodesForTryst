So there are two file:

"CodeToPut.c "

and 

"motorTest.c"


##Step 1 :

First put "motor.c" on arduino and then play it.
The code will make arduino 

-move forward for 3 seconds
-move backward for 3 seconds
-move clockwise for 3 seconds
-move anticlockwise for 3 seconds

and repeat.....

If this is how the bot moves due to the above code. The motors are configured correctly and proceed for the next step.


#Step 2 :

Load the file CodeToPut.c on the arduino board and run it on the arena. The bot should follow line and follow that 90 degree turn too.


##Note: To load a file onto arduino board. Copy the content of that file as it is, to the arduino software and click on upload button.
